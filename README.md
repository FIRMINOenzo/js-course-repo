# js-course-repo

This in an repository for my projects of a Java Script course that i'm doing...

The course's language is English, so i'll try to take all my notes in English also, taking the opportunity to improve my English.

# First Project - Task List

The first project of the course is a Task List and we did this page from scratch, so we started with the HTML, wich was a kind of easy, because of Materialize CSS and Font Awesome.

**The page layout:**

- A card with a field where you can put the task you want to add;
- A button to add the task in the list;
- A filter field, where you can filter the tasks to find the wanted one;
- A list of all tasks saved;
- And last but not least, we have a Clear Task button, witch function is clear all tasks.

## What we've used to build this

The main concept we were tryng to learn was DOM manipulation, so the project turn around this:

- We've used querySelector to get elements from HTML to JS;
- We also had use EventListners to run an event after certain action from the user;
- We've used functions to atribute to the Event Listners;
- We did element creation in JS, adding classes and other elements inside;
- And, to save all the tasks, even if the browser was closed, we used Local Storage.

## What I thought about this project

Well, this is a easy project, we don't used advanced things, but we've used the basic with all his potencial, manipulating every element that we needed, without feeling that's something missing or we need more to complete the project.

# Second Project - Loan Calculator

There is the second project of the course, and it's a basic Loan Calculator, instead of using Materialize like in the first project, in this we have used Bootstrap, that i've liked it so much.

**The page layout:**

- A main card with all needed informations;
- A amount field;
- A interest field;
- And a years to payment field;
- A button to calculate the loan;
- And last, it have a result card, wich contains the monthly payment, the total payment and then the total interest.

## What we've used to build this

Well, similar to the first project, we've used DOM manipulation to creat new things, like:

- The main use was the math and its application in programming;
- A custom error alert if the insert values are wrong or missing;
- Also the method style.display = 'none' or 'block' to make things appear and disappear from the UI;
- A loading GIF to make the UI feels better to the user;
- Functions like setTimeout() to the elements, like the error message appear just for two seconds.

## What I thought about this project

I cannot say that project was hard to complete, but i cannot say it was nothing too. Took the elements value from HTML, pass to JS, then work this values with math, make the entire result card apper before the calculation was done was really good to improve my skills and my logic and i'm loving how it was hard in past, but it's becoming a normal thing right now.
