# js-course-repo
This in an repository for my projects of a Java Script course that i'm doing...

The course's language is English, so i'll try to take all my notes in English also, taking the opportunity to improve my English.

# First Project - Task List
The first project of the course is a Task List and we did this page from scratch, so we started with the HTML, wich was a kind of easy, because of materialize CSS and Font Awesome.

**The page have a simple layout:**
 * A card with a field where you can put the task you want to add;
 * A button to add the task in the list;
 * A filter field, where you can filter the tasks to find the wanted one;
 * A list of all tasks saved;
 * And last but not least, we have a Clear Task button, witch function is clear all tasks.

## What've we used to build this
The main concept we were tryng to learn was DOM manipulation, so the project turn around this:
 * We've used querySelector to get elements from HTML to JS;
 * We also had use EventListners to run an event after certain action from the user;
 * We've used functions to atribute to the Event Listners;
 * We did element creation in JS, adding classes and other elements inside;
 * And, to save all the tasks, even if the browser was closed, we used Local Storage.

## What I think about this project
Well, this is a easy project, we don't used advanced things, but we've used the basic with all his potencial, manipulating every element that we needed, without feeling that's something missing or we need more to complete the project.
